      <h2>Front End Developing vs Back End Developing</h2>
      <ul>

          <li>PHP: PHP is designed to pull and edit information in the database. It’s most commonly bundled with databases written in the SQL language. PHP was designed strictly for the web and remains one of the most widely used languages around. The versatility of the language and the frameworks it powers make employment options numerous and diverse. </li>
          <img src="img/php.png">
          <li>Ruby: Ruby is equal parts simplicity and complexity, pairing simple code with more flexibility and extra tools. Ruby bundles the back end with database functionality that PHP and SQL can offer as a pair—it’s great for startups, easy maintenance, and high-traffic demands. It's very popular with startups and smaller companies</li>
          <img src="img/ruby.png">
          <li>Python: With fewer lines of code, the Python programming language is fast, making it ideal for getting things to market quickly. The emphasis is on readability and simplicity, which makes it great for beginners.</li>
