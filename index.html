      <h2>Front End Developing vs Back End Developing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Front End: Front-end developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design.</li>
        <li>Back End: Back-end developers are usually write the web services and APIs used by front-end developers and mobile application developers.</p>

          <li>PHP: PHP is designed to pull and edit information in the database. It’s most commonly bundled with databases written in the SQL language. PHP was designed strictly for the web and remains one of the most widely used languages around.</li>
          <img src="img/php.png">
          <li>Ruby: Ruby is equal parts simplicity and complexity, pairing simple code with more flexibility and extra tools. Ruby bundles the back end with database functionality that PHP and SQL can offer as a pair—it’s great for startups, easy maintenance, and high-traffic demands.</li>

          <li>Python: With fewer lines of code, the Python programming language is fast, making it ideal for getting things to market quickly. The emphasis is on readability and simplicity, which makes it great for beginners.</li>
