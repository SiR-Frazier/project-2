      <ul>
        <li>Front End: Front-end developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design.</li>
        <li>Back End: Back-end developers are usually write the web services and APIs used by front-end developers and mobile application developers.</p>
      </ul>

          <img src="img/php.png">
          <li><u>Ruby</u>: Ruby is equal parts simplicity and complexity, pairing simple code with more flexibility and extra tools.
